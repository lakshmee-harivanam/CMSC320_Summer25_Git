Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: We use Git to manage code and data changes when working with a team. It helps developers manage and track changes to their code, allowing them to go back to previous versions if anything goes wrong.<

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to the medical field to help doctors detect dieases (like diabetes) early. For example, data scientistis can look at paitent data (like age, weight, blood sugar levels) and apply statistical modeling/analysis to figure out who could get sick in the future.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging essentially applies the changes made on a certain feature branch to the current branch it is on (like how we combined q1 into our main branch). It is able to keep the history (all commits) of both branches and show the path each branch took in order to come together. However, rebasing essentially "replays" the changes that we made from a feature branch (like q3) on another branch (like main). This changes the order of our commits and makes it look like our changes are most recent.
